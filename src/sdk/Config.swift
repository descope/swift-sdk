/// For example, when testing code that uses the Descope SDK we might want to make
/// sure no network requests are actually made. A simple `DescopeNetworkClient`
/// implementation that always throws an error might look like this:
///
///     class FailingNetworkClient: DescopeNetworkClient {

/// in `URLSession`, so if for example all we want is for network requests made by
/// the Descope SDK to use the same `URLSession` instance we use elsewhere we can

///
///     let descopeSDK = DescopeSDK(projectId: "...") { config in
///         config.networkClient = AppNetworkClient(session: appSession)
